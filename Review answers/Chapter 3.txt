1/2. What is meant by the term prompt and which operator do you use to read into a variable?
	It means getting asking the user for input using cin command operator.

3.If you want the user to input an integer value into your program for a variable named number, what are two lines of code you could write to ask the user to do it and to input the value into your program?

int number;
cout << "Please enter an integer!\n";
cin >> number;

4. What is \n called and what purpose does it serve?
A \n is a new line character that introduces a new line in your program.

5. What terminates input into a string?
Strings of characters

6. What terminates input into an integer?
Integers.

7. How would you write

cout << "Hello, ";
cout << first_name;
cout << "!\n";

as a single line of code?

cout << "Hello, " << first_name << "!\n";

8. What is an object?
An object is a region of memory with a type that specifies what kind of information can be placed in it.

9. What is a literal?
A literal is a fixed value that the program may not alter.

10. What kinds of literals are there?
-Integer literals
-Boolean literals
-Strings literals
-Character literals

11. What is a variable?
A variable is a named object.

12 - What are typical sizes for a char, an int, and a double?
Char has a size of 1 byte (8bits)
int has a size of 8 bytes (32 bits).
double has a size of 8 bytes.

13 - What measures do we use for the size of small entities in memory, such as ints and strings?
Bits.

14- What is the difference between = and ==?
A single '=' is an assignment operator, whereas '==' is a comparing operator.

15 - What is a definition?
A definition is a unique specification of an object,variable, function, etc, such as defining a variable name my_number with type int.

Ex:
int my_number;

16. What is an initialization and how does it differ from an assignment?
Initialization is the same as attributing a variable its initial value, such as:
int number = 0;
Assignment is simply attributing to a variable a new value.

17. What is string concatenation and how do you make it work in C++?
String concatenation is to add two, or more string variables together.
In C++ we concatenate two strings using the following program:

string name = "I am Pedro";
string age = "and I have 24 years old.";

cout << name + age << "\n";

22. Why can conversion from double to int be a bad thing?
Because if we have a double such as 2.6 and convert into int we loose data as that conversion will attribute the integer a value of 2 and 0.6 will be lost.

23. Define a rule to help decide if a conversion from one type to another is safe or unsafe.
Using a list based notation "{}" on initializing a variable.
